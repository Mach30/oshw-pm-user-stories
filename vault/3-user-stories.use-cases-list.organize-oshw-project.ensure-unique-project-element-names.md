## notes

- e.g., unique part numbers within a project
- any instance of a component in DOF needs to have a (fully qualified?) singular definitive name; this should be one-to-one and onto
- need to address how this works with sub-projects and name-spacing
  - see object-oriented paradigm
  - see fully-qualified naming processes
- needs to be addressed in m30ml
