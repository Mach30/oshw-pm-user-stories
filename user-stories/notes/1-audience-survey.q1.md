## notes

- led prototype board light-on wsd 20 clone stm32 - up and running
- halloween vending machine
- diffs are useless unless you pay for a service
- would like to build earrings for rabbi
- openscad - jump to microelectronics
- challenge getting into digital space
- "structural diffing" - see diff tastic
- need for name-spacing; unambiguous means of referencing component instances
  - need a means of mapping dof schema to other tools (e.g., KiCad, FreeCAD)
- rc2014
